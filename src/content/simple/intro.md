Hi there, my name is **Antonio Chaires** :). I am Computer Science grad from [Tec de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/es), in Guadalajara, and currently work at **Meta** as a **Production Engineer** in New York City.

I mostly write about random thoughts that come to mind here, as well as cool stuff i've learned through years of reading books and building projects in my free time.
