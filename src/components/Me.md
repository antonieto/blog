# Who am I?
Tough question, here's my try.

My full name is José Antonio Chaires Monroy. I am a Computer Science undergraduate from [Tec de Monterrey](https://www.tec.mx). I currently live and work in New York City, as a **Production Engineer** at Meta.

## Mi amigo del mar

At the time I am writing this I am 22 years old. I was born in a city on the coast of Mexico in 2002, and I was raised in a pretty small and beautiful near the beach town called Cihuatlán, Jalisco, and through my childhood years I became a lover of the sea and especially its food and how it's cooked in the region. I love food, and in fact, I come from a family of restaurant owners. My family owns a popular local Birria restaurant called **La Birria de las 12**, considered by many (myself included) the best Birria in the region. You can guess I have a pretty high bar when it comes to food.

I also have a strong passion for **running**. I run pretty much every day, and up to 60KM a week. And speaking of passion, art and especially music is a big part of me. I taught myself how to play the piano at age 15 and to this day I love to make all kinds of music in my computer.

Art and culture are two of my main ways of communication. I can instantly connect with people through music or discussing any other form of art. Sometimes more so than through a regular conversation. I believe this is the case because words don't come out easily from me and I tend to be better at more abstract levels of reasoning (or maybe i'm just bad with words).

## I can write code
If you are reading this you probably found my blog either because I sent it to you or you found it in a techy place like my twitter account, which means you may be interested in my techincal background.

During my time in college, I did two **Software Engineering internships** at **Google**, one of them remotely and another one in Sunnyvale, CA. I also had the chance to work at two different **YC** backed **startups**, **Lizza** and **[Atrato](https://www.atratopago.com/)**, where I collaborated to complete several complex projects such as a Firestore -> SQL migration.

### Web, compilers, AI
I am very passionate about the web. The vast majority of my experience with programming is related to web applications in some sense and i have probably written over 100 thousand lines of **TypeScript** code, both frontend (__Angular__ and __React__) and backend. I strongly lean towards working on __infrastructure__ related projects, though, and in fact that is where most of my experience comes from, having written __Go__, __Java__, __Python__ and __C++__ code extensively throughout my career.

I had the amazing oportunity to take a __Compilers Design__ class during an exchange semester in Spain and fell in love with the topic. I developed a [compiler](https://github.com/antonieto/plc-compiler) for a pretty high level and basic language called __PLC__ (will describe the process in another post), a couple of Java libraries. If life gives me a chance, I would love to do research in this area.

In the recent months, I fell victim to FOMO due to all the crazy stuff going on with AI, which led me to become very interested in the math and the technologies behind it. In fact, my role at Meta is under the AI umbrella of the company and work in infrastructure development for PyTorch.
